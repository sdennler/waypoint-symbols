This are some symbols for waypoints to use in QLandkarte GT which match the ones on Garmin Devices.

You find the ready to use symbols in the folder finished. Copy them to ~/.config/QLandkarteGT/WaypointIcons/ to uses in QLandkarte GT.

If you like to edit the symbols or add more, its best to use Inkscape to edit the file garmin_symbols.svg. After, export the symbols whit the export function to png files and use the script rename_sym.sh (it will overwrite files in finished and the QLandkarte config directory!) so they have the right names.
And yes, it would be great to have your edits in this repository to!

All symbols are from The Open Clipart Library (OCAL) (http://openclipart.org/) or drawn/modivied by me.
