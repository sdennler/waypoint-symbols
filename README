This are some symbols for waypoints to use in QLandkarte GT which match the ones on Garmin Devices. In addition, there are a few new symbols which can be put on some Garmin devices as well.

You find the ready to use symbols for QLandkarte GT in the folder finished. Copy them to ~/.config/QLandkarteGT/WaypointIcons/ to uses in QLandkarte GT.
In the folder garmin are the new symbols ready to be used on Garmin Devices. Copy them to the folder Garmin/CustomSymbols on your device.

If you like to edit the symbols or add more, its best to use Inkscape to edit the file garmin_symbols.svg. After, export the symbols whit the export function to png files and use the script rename_sym.sh (it will overwrite files in finished and the QLandkarte config directory!) so they have the right names.
And yes, it would be great to have your edits in this repository to!
